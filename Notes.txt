When a package/command in python is needed, its usually not a application/binary. It is a module that has to be downloaded and installed for python to use. To do this, python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt and list the file in the requirements file. Or python3 -m pip install module1 module2

Add python to Path - PATH=$PATH:/Users/wesleyr/Library/Python/3.8/bin
May get an error about the python files not being found. By defualt macos uses "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/python3".
    make: pytest: No such file or directory

Expanding a list naturally using star - 
>>> print(*mylist)

Adding comma's to a list. Seperator can also be changed to anything else. 
>>> print(', '.join(myl)) 

The addargument usage depends on the name of argument definded in --"name". Otherwise, attribute wont be available:
  parser.add_argument('-s','--sorted')
  if args.sorting:
  AttributeError: 'Namespace' object has no attribute 'sorting' <---
